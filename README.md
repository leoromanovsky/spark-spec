# Spark Spec

This project is a collection of utility classes to make ease testing Apache Spark programs.

I've divided it into two directories:

* core - The library which a developer includes into their project.
* examples - A standalone sbt project meant to be fully transferable.

I welcome feedback, issue reports and pull requests.
